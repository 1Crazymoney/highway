Another C++ library for portable SIMD exists: third_party/dimsum.
It follows a different design philosophy, see the discussion in
http://go/simd-api-comments.

To the best of our knowledge, Dimsum has not been under active development since
2018-07.

third_party/highway is under continuous development since 2017 (originally in
third_party pik/simd).
